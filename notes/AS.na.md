Introduction
GG Theme
Act 1: The Encounter
INT. TEA SHOP - NOON
(The tea shop is cozy, filled with the aroma of brewing tea
and murmurs of patrons. A1, 16, sits alone at a table, lost
in thought, staring into his half-empty cup.)

A1'S POV:

(The door chimes as a customer
enters. A1 looks up and freezes. S1,
looking exactly as he did the day he
died, walks in casually and sits at a
table across from A1.)

S1:

(Smiling, as if nothing is out of the
ordinary)
Hey, A1. Paathu romba naal achu la?.
PSS_14[00:00-00:37]
A1:

(Stunned, barely able to speak)
S1? Dei, neeya, nee sethuta dhaane
!??.

S1:
(Chuckling)
Adhuku
A1:

(Panicking, stands up abruptly)
Idhu unma illa, illa

(A1 rushes out of the tea shop, knocking over his chair.)
EXT. STREETS - NIGHT
(A1 runs through the dimly lit streets, his breathing heavy.
He slows down and leans against a lamp post, trying to
collect himself.)
Act 2: The Confrontation

EXT. ABANDONED HOTEL - NIGHT
(A1, now calmer, walks aimlessly and finds himself in front
of an old, decrepit hostel. Drawn by a strange pull, he
enters.)
INT. ABANDONED HOSTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT

PSS_15

A1: (CONT'D)

(More composed but still confused)
Unaku enna venum, nee en Inga irruka

S1:

(Leaning casually against the desk)
You ran. I followed. Simple as that.

A1:
(Angry, desperate)
This isn’t funny, S1. Nee sethuta.
Nee epdi Inga irrukalam?

S1:

(Smiling enigmatically)
Does that matter? Maranam oru
vaartha. Existence... Konjam
complicated.
A1:
(Shouting)
Enna da olarrine irruka?

S1:

(Laughing softly, then serious)
Yosi da, A1. Vaalka na enna? Naalu
moment kortha oru chain. And death?
Just another moment. Nothing more,
nothing less.
A1:
(Frustrated)
Enna da pesara. Apo en life ku point
eh illaya.
S1:
(Walking closer)
Andhu dhaan da point eh Life doesn’t
have to make sense. Adhu odum avalo
thaan yaarukume wait pannadhu. We
exist in the chaos, finding meaning
where we can.

A1:

(More composed, yet still bewildered)
Ellame... random ah?

S1:
(Grinning)
Exactly! Vaazhka oru loosu painter
canvas Mela paint kotra maari. You
can try to make sense of the
splatters, or you can just enjoy the
art.

Act 3: The Acceptance
INT. ABANDONED HOTEL - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Yaar Nee[1:47-2:20]

(A1 and S1 sit on the rooftop, looking out at the city
lights in the distance. The atmosphere is calm, almost
serene.)

A1:

(Quieter now, reflective)
So, ippo enna? Nee irruka... Naa
irruken... Idhuku enna arthum?

S1:
(Gazing at the sky)
It means whatever you want it to
mean. We’re just echoes, A1. Echoes
of existence, resonating through
time. Maybe I’m here to remind you of
that.

A1:

(Nodding slowly, understanding
dawning)
So, naanum neeyu onna?

S1:
(Smiling warmly)
Exactly. It’s all part of the same
melody. Now... Vaa pogalam.

A1:

(Standing up, hesitant but resolved)
Enga porum?
Maranam kudadha[00:40-1:27]

S1:

(Extending his hand)
Enga pona unaku enna vaa pogalam


(A1 takes S1’s hand, and together they walk towards the edge
of the rooftop. The screen fades to black, leaving only the
echo of their footsteps.)
FADE OUT.
