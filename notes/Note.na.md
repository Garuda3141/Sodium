#Note

as an artist one has to spend time griding and honing their technique during off-time.
but when it comes to creation, the artist/creator must forget all the rules/guidelines

to crash through to the glass ceiling of self projection with a just fist and hopefully not travel far to land onto the inner softwood of reality
