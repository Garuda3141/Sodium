# idealism


[[Note]]

the meaning of life without a sense of perfection

axioms(things I assume are true): no perfection; humans need motive to live; I am always right.

what are ideals, they are the "perfect" version of a given object

lets assume ideals exist

if they do all objects are an imperfect version of an ideal, but if all entities are imperfect humans cannot have a sense of what's perfect hence perfection in humans is illogical

unless humans inherently have a sense of perfection in which case if two humans have conflicting views of perfection then ideals don't exist and perfection does not too.

(perfection does not exist in human nature let alone friendships)

now that perfection does not exist, what's meaning

lets assume meaning in one's life is the sole motivator of survival

humans have been battling with this topic for the past 6000 years, but I think I have an idea

it is a three pronged approach

the first being there is no meaning, the environment is apathetic to humans and we are nothing but a biological process that simulates consciousness.

this approach requires a concrete definition of consciousness

lets take two methods

consciousness is a behaviour exhibited by an entity.

or

consciousness is an entity in its own right

lets take the first case

it can be disproved by the fact that consciousness can be mimicked, for eg given a text box a normal person cannot find the difference between a chat bot trained well and a human, this could be overcome by assurning chatbots are consious

that would lead to a slippery slope where response to stimuli could be constructed as consciousness and the word would lose its classical definition

now the second case

if consciousness is an entity in its own right, where does it reside? as lobotomies exist and the soul energy bullshit is too stupid for my liking it seems consciousness is distributed over a large area whose components are unconscious.

this leads to the hard problem of consciousness, which is how do non-conscious matter lead to conscious life?

this question does not have a beginning to a beginning to an answer

hence the first approach is wrong or its so hard that we cannot even start to fathom an answer

second being meaning is self constructed

everyone is on their own journey, meaning is a shirt you have to stitch yourself blah blah blah. this is a personal way and there are no right nor wrong answers.


third being the meaning meaning of life is to live itself. that is in a universe devoid of bias and meaning, living for the sake of living is a rebellious act against the indifference of the universe and environment and in itself contains meaning


this is borderline circular reasoning, it claims the mere act of existing provides meaning for life. but the axioms we stated said people need motivation to live.

this implies motivation leads to motivation
in conclusion in an universe void of perfection, meaning is either [too hard to decipher] or [does not exist] or [self referential] or [self made]

all of these options are equally valid and sound

hope this proves my case

"there is no perfection, meaning of life is uncertain (1/4) chance of being right‚Äù
